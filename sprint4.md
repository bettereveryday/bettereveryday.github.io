### Challenge: Post / poles challenge

### Day 1 - Intro to PHP and it's Basic Language Constructs
- WORDPRESS
	- TALK by @Sarah Maynard
	- WARNING: Procedural not OOP
- Syntax [LSD]
    - keywords, formatting
	    - PSR2
    - examples of syntax in different languages
	    - Rosetta Code
    - syntax vs semantics
	    >The term syntax refers to grammatical structure whereas the term semantics refers to the meaning of the vocabulary symbols arranged with that structure. Grammatical (syntactically valid) does not imply sensible (semantically valid), however.
	    
    - __EXERCISE:__ tidy up the format of some messy code (without using beautifier)
- What is PHP? [MO]
	- php.ini
	- ```phpinfo()``` 
	- __EXERCISE:__ Write a hello word program 
- Quotes [LSD]
	- Single vs double quotes
	- "Variable Interpolation" 
	- Special Characters [LSD]
	- ```"\n; \t; \\"``` 
	- Concatenation
	- HEREDOC / NOWDOC 
		- ```$story = EOS>>>```
	- print vs echo vs printf (or sprintf)
	- [Php.net - strings](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php)
	- EXERCISE: practice each type
- Comments [MO]
	- Single line
	- Multi line
	- Standard formats e.g DocBlocks
- Data Types [LSD]
	- ```String; Integer; Float; Boolean``` 
	- Typed Languages
	- Static/dynamic type checking
	- Type juggling & type casting
- Precedence [MO]
	- [Operator Precedence](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.php) 
- Symbols [LSD]
	- Logical ```! && ||```
		- [Google Doodle - George Boole](www.google.co.uk)
	- Assignment ```=```
	- Comparison ```== === != !==```
	- Compound assignment ```*= /= += -=```
	- Increment/decrement ```++ --``` 
- Variables [MO]
	- What is a variable?
	- Allowable names
	>Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: ```'[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*' ```
	
- Variable Variables: ```$$foo``` [LSD]
	```
	$a = 'hello';
	$$a = 'world';
	echo "$a ${$a}";
	
	//You can even add more Dollar Signs

  $Bar = "a";
  $Foo = "Bar";
  $World = "Foo";
  $Hello = "World";
  $a = "Hello";

  $a; //Returns Hello
  $$a; //Returns World
  $$$a; //Returns Foo
  $$$$a; //Returns Bar
  $$$$$a; //Returns a
  $$$$$$a; //Returns Hello
  $$$$$$$a; //Returns World

  //... and so on ...//
	```
	
- Constants [MO]
	- ```define("PI", 3.1415927);```
	
	>__Differences between constants and variables are:__
    > There is no need to write a dollar sign ($) before a constant, where as in Variable one has to write a dollar sign.
    >Constants cannot be defined by simple assignment, they may only be defined using the define() function.
    >Constants may be defined and accessed anywhere without regard to variable scoping rules.
    >Once the Constants have been set, may not be redefined or undefined.




### Day 2 - Control Flow

- Arrays
	- Indexed arrays (Numeric, Enumerative)
	```
	$days_array = array('Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun');

	 ```
	- Associative arrays
	- ```$personal_details = array("Name" => 'John Doe', "Age" => 21, "Sex" => 'Male')'``` 
	- key / value
	- Multi-dimensional arrays
	- Adding to arrays
	- Iterating through arrays ```foreach ($names as $name) {...}``
	- Array Functions
	
- Operators
	- Assignment Operators
	- Combining Operators
	- Mathematical Operators
	- String Operators ```. .=```
	- Comparison Operators
	- Logical Operators
		- ```and or xor not```
		- Difference between ```and``` and ```&&``` (precedence)
- Conditionals
	- if
	- if ... else
	- elseif
	- switch
	- coding style (PSR)
	- Single line if is BAD
	- Ternary Operator ```(<condition>) ? <value if true> : <value if false>;```
- Loops
	- for
	- while
	- do-while
	- foreach
	- continue / break
	- Embedded loops
